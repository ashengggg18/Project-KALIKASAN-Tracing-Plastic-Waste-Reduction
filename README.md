## Project Description
Project KALIKASAN: Tracing Plastic Waste Reduction is a Java-based program that tracks and records each user’s plastic waste reduction activities. The system allows users to input data about their daily plastic usage and recycling habits. Using Java’s data handling and file management features, it securely stores and updates each user’s progress. It also generates reports showing how much plastic waste each user has reduced over time. Through this project, Java technology is used to promote environmental responsibility and encourage sustainable living practices.

## OOP Concepts Applied
In this project, we used several Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to make the system more organized and efficient. We started by applying encapsulation, which allowed us to hide sensitive data like user records inside classes and only expose what was necessary through getters and setters. This kept the program safe from accidental data changes. We also used inheritance to create reusable class structures, making the code easier to maintain and extend in the future. Another important concept we applied was polymorphism, which helped us create flexible methods that can behave differently depending on the object calling them. This made the program more adaptable when dealing with different types of user data. The use of abstraction also simplified complex processes by breaking them down into clear, manageable functions. applying these OOP principles made the project cleaner, more scalable, and easier to understand.

## Program Structure
The program is structured around several main classes, each designed to handle a specific role. At the center of everything is the User class, which stores the user’s name, daily waste details, and progress data. We also created a PlasticTracker class that manages all the calculations and updates related to plastic waste reduction. The FileHandler class is responsible for reading and writing user data so the system can store progress securely. Another important class is the ReportGenerator, which compiles the user’s data and converts it into readable progress reports. All these classes work together using simple relationships that make the system easy to navigate. The structure follows a text-based hierarchy where each class has one specific job, helping avoid confusion and unnecessary complications. This organized setup allows the program to run smoothly and makes future improvements easier to add.
